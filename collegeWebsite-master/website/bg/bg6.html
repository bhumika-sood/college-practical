<p>It is very well said that “There is no such thing as a special category of science called applied science; there is science and its applications, which are related to one another as the fruit is related to the tree that has borne it.” by louis Pasteur. AS we believe that A structure gets its strength from its foundation and we at MGMCoET believe in strong and solid base. In today's environment, strategies need to be dynamic with a strong root and base. A fresh approach coupled with new ideas can provide the leverage and the power to meet the need and challenges faced by the technocrats’ today. A structure gets it strength from inception and the department of Basic Sciences and Humanities of MGMCoET coincides with these changes.
