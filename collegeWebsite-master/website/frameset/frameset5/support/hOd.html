<h2>Welcome to the Department of Civil Engineering of Mahatma Gandhi Mission College of Engineering & Technology, Noida. The Department was established in 2012, and offers Undergraduate program (B. Tech) Civil engineering with an intake of 60 students every year. Civil engineers do great things for society and are responsible for the infrastructure the backbone of economy; the buildings that we live, work, and recreate in; and systems that protect us against natural disasters. In other words, civil engineers make our society sustainable. With our project-based education, emphasis on experiential learning, and collaborative environment, our students are exposed to a multitude of options in their curriculum. <br>
The department has good infrastructure and is equipped with full-fledged laboratories such as CAD lab, Fluid Mechanics Lab, Structural Analysis Lab, Engineering Mechanics lab, Building Materials and Construction Lab, Transportation Lab etc.
The department is having well qualified and experienced faculty members. The faculty motivate and guide the students to do projects related to Advanced Technologies in Civil Engineering. <br>
The department aims at developing analytical and experimental skills in students to apply in various fields of Civil Engineering using National and International codes. The department also provides an opportunity for students in improving managerial, communication and presentation skills, knowledge of software like Auto CAD, STAAD PRO etc. The students are exposed to Industrial Training and visit live projects to gain practical knowledge and understanding of field constraints. <br>
Audiovisual classes are conducted as per Time-Table to provide inputs to the budding engineers and expose them to various theoretical concepts. Our goal is to provide students with a balance of intellectual and practical experiences that enable them to serve a variety of societal needs.
Department has established Students Society of Civil Engineering (SENSUS) to provide a platform for the students to apply their learning and further their understanding through collaborative projects.<br>
Please do visit our website for more details and feel free to approach us with your queries. I wish a very best of luck to the students.
