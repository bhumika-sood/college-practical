<h2>I feel ecstatic to introduce you to Department of Applied Sciences, which is the foundation of Engineers. Department of Applied Sciences strives for increasing the knowledge, enhancing the critical thinking, ability to change information into knowledge and power of analyzing the things technically of each and every individual of ever changing society through students. We always intend to impart knowledge through a closed knit family of highly competent faculty. Department of Applied Sciences plays a vital role in an engineering college catering to the teaching of basic Sciences and Humanities courses for engineering students of all branches. The purpose of applied sciences in Engineering study is to lay a strong foundation of basic principles of various disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Communication Skills in the mind of the learners, so that they proceed to rest of their years of study with up to date knowledge and training of basic engineering skills. Our Laboratories have been very well established not only to cover complete syllabus but to motivate students to learn beyond the syllabus which definitely develops complete knowledge of the subject (both the practical and theoretical depth of knowledge) and develop skill sets of students to become promising engineers in future. I would like to conclude with the words of Thomas Friedman who has rightly opined “World is flat. Opportunities are immense. It’s just a question of identifying opportunities and making the best of them”. I wish a very best of luck to the students…
