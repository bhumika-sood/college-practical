<b>My Dear Students,<br></b>
<p>Engineering is not just about a few mandatory courses and elective programs, it is a process intended to bring about transformation in your perspective and is about giving you new thoughts, new visions and new ambitions with scientific approach. With Liberalization and Globalization, the India corporate sectors felt the need to reposition itself, quickly in order to effectively respond to emerging competition and also exploit the opportunities. <br>
The new challenges will not be surmounted with yesterday's concepts and the day before yesterday's strategies and technologies but rather with our ability and thinking futuristic and redefining our action plan for today.<br> 
To cater to this requirement, we aim to live up to our mission to groom young future engineers to be complete, value driven human beings and competent professionals with global outlook and capable of functioning in cross functional teams, to balance scientific principles with practical applications in Engineering design. <br>
I personally believe that these years of your youth are golden years of your life and when you make up your mind to invest four such years in any program, you should ensure that you make the optimum use of available opportunities, nurturing your individual personalities to the Zenith. 
We are proud that MGMCoET, Noida is synonymous with practical, Industry-focused education and attracts the ‘Best Students’ from across U.P and other neighbouring states. <br>
<br>
<b>Wishing you a happy & fruitful stay at MGMCoET, Noida.</b><br><br>
<b>Kamalkishor N. Kadam<br>
Chairman</b></p>
